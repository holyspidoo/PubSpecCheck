# PubSpecCheck

Utility to check the versions of packages in a pubspec.yaml file. Useful to see if there is a shift in major versions _(ex: 0.7.0 to 0.8.0)_ so you can update your version rules inside the pubspec file.

## Usage

```
dart SpecCheck.dart yourfile.yaml
```

## Notes

No error handling of any kind, this is just a quick and dirty script ðŸ™‚
